        <p>When I was young my grandma moved down to a small island of the cost of South Carolina named Hilton Head. When we went to visist I fell in love with the laided back nature, the beaches, and the golf.

            <h2>Beaches</h2>

            <p>Being from the midwest seeing the beach for the first time was always going to be memrable. Walking up the sand dunes and finaly getting to see the ocean is something that I will never forget. </p>
            <h3>Golf</h3>

            <p>Hiltond Head is also where my love of golf developed. Hilton Head is a pretty small island but besides it beaches it is most know for its golf. The island is only about 10 miles long but has around 40 golf courses. I had played some course around my house but the course on this island are in a different league. It was hear that golf and playing on great course in great places became a passion of ming.
